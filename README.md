# 🥚 Eggspress Delivery

_Once upon a cluck..._

A brave little chick hatched into chaos. Six eggs entered the world — only one made it. The rest? **Egg-napped!**  
Now, it’s up to our yolk-fueled hero to race against time, dodge danger, and rescue his siblings before they become someone’s breakfast.

Welcome to **Eggspress Delivery** — a fast-paced, third-person 3D platformer packed with action, humor, and a whole lot of shells.

## 🛠️ About the Project

This is one of my **first ever game development projects** using Unity 🎉  
My goal was to learn about player controls, game design, UI, audio systems, and overall Unity workflow. While it’s a humble start, I had a lot of fun building this, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving.

Feel free to explore, play, or leave feedback. Every suggestion helps me grow as a developer!
